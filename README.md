# Python-Analysis


In this assignment, i have used the concepts of Python for analyzing analyze the financial records and vote counting process . 

Both tasks present a real-world situation where the newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.
For this project i have created  a main folder called Python-analysis and 
inside that there is two sub folders called PyBank and PyPoll
and inside each folders i have created three subcategories a file called main.py, This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. 
An Analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from the analysis.


PyBank

In this,  a Python script is used to analyze the financial records of the company's financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

A Python script is used to analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

THe output of the analysis is as follows:

PyPoll

In this, helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

The data set given is the poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
A Python script is ueds to analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes
